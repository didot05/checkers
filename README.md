# CandNO : 221455 
- For the assessment of Knowledge & Reasoning 2021/22 UG 3rd Year.

- AI implemented for against player with Minimax-algorithm that is optimized by alpha-beta pruning.

# This assessment ZIP folder include
- 1. README.txt
- 2. Report in pdf
- 3. main.py (executable file for python checkers game) in sources code file
- 4. Checkers.zip folder for all sources code (contents are just same as in this folder's *.py files. The Zip folder only has been compressed and stored all .py files in one place.)
- 5. site-packages.zip (pygame libraries)

# To run the program
To run this checkers game, just simply run the main.py. However, VsCode&Pygame should be properly installed for running this program.
Also, please unzip the two *.zip files. (assets & __pycache__) 
- 1. Download&Install visual studio code through following site: https://code.visualstudio.com/  
- 2. Install proper extension of visual studio code (1. Python 2. Python Extended 3. Python Extension Pack)
- 3. Install pygame (I confirm that this program work well on Lab. Plus, most of Lab's computer already have pygame library, however if your computer doesn't have pygame,
     just open the command prompt and put the command as shown: pip install pygame
     Or, if it the command doesn't work well, just unzip the 5. site-packages.zip folder(include ’pygame’, ’pygame-2.0.1.dist-info’) and 
     put them on the proper path where your computer store all of your external python libraries.)
- 4. Run main.py through VSCode (Click the file above and select the 'K&R_Ass1_221455' folder to open properly)
** The more detailed description is on the 2. Compilation and Run section in the 2. Report in pdf. Please refer to that. **
